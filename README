1. Demonstrate multiple graph traversal algos

2. Build binary search tree, heaps, etc

3. Explain tiered memory cached systems

In a tiered memory cache system the top tier is generally the smallest and fastest cache 'level.' As you move down the tier the memory size increases and the speed decreases.

4. Identify disconnected graph components

5. Build graph clusters using similarity metrics
